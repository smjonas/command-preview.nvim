## :sparkles: Motivation and Features
In Neovim version 0.8, the `command-preview` feature was introduced.
Despite its name, it does not enable automatic previewing of any command.
Instead, users must manually update the buffer text and set highlights *for each command* they wish to preview.

This plugin addresses that limitation by offering a **simple API for creating previewable commands**
in Neovim. Just specify the command you want to preview and live-command will handle the rest.
This includes viewing **individual insertions, changes and deletions** as you type.

## Requirements
Neovim 0.8+

## :inbox_tray: Installation
Install via your favorite package manager and call the `setup` function:

<details>
    <summary>lazy.nvim</summary>

```lua
use {
  "smjonas/live-command.nvim",
  -- live-command supports semantic versioning via Git tags
  -- tag = "2.*",
  config = function()
    require("live-command").setup()
  end,
}
```
</details>

<details>
    <summary>vim-plug</summary>

```vim
Plug 'smjonas/live-command.nvim'
```
In your `init.lua`, call the setup function:
```lua
require("live-command").setup()
```
</details>

## :rocket: Getting started
### Basic Usage
The easiest way to use **live-command** is with the provided `:Preview` command.
For example, `:Preview delete` will show you a preview of deleting the current line.
You can also provide a count or a range to the command, such as `:'<,'>Preview norm A;`, which
shows the effect of appending a semicolon to every visually selected line.

### Creating Previewable Commands
For a more convenient experience, **live-command** allows you to define custom previewable commands.
This can be done by passing a list of commands to the `setup` function.
For instance, to define a custom `:Norm` command that can be previewed, use the following:
```lua
require("live-command").setup {
  commands = {
    Norm = { cmd = "norm" },
  },
}
```

Each command you want to preview needs a name (which must be uppercase) and
an existing command to run on each keypress, specified via the `cmd` field.

## :gear: Customization

All of the following options can be set globally (affecting all custom commands), or per command.

To change the default options globally, use the `defaults` table. The default settings are:

```lua
require("live-command").setup {
  defaults = {
    enable_highlighting = true,
    inline_highlighting = true,
    hl_groups = {
      insertion = "DiffAdd",
      deletion = "DiffDelete",
      change = "DiffChange",
    },
  },
}
```

---

`enable_highlighting: boolean`

Default: `true`

Determines whether highlights should be shown. If `false`, only text changes are shown, without any highlights.

---

`inline_highlighting: boolean`

Default: `true`

If `true`, differing lines will be compared in a second run of the diff algorithm
to identify smaller differences. This can result in multiple highlights per line.
If set to `false`, the whole line will be highlighted as a single change.

---

`hl_groups: table<string, string|boolean>`

Default: `{ insertion = "DiffAdd", deletion = "DiffDelete", change = "DiffChange" }`

A table mapping edit types (insertion, deletion or change) to highlight groups used for highlighting buffer changes.
This table is merged with the defaults, allowing you to omit any keys that match the default.
If a value is set to `false`, no highlights will be shown for that type.
If `hl_groups.deletion` is `false`, deletion edits will not be undone, so deleted text won't be highlighted.
